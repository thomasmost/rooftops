      A new class of person has appeared in the world.
      Superhumans roam the streets, maraud the bay, and patrol the sky.
      Uncommon but no longer unthinkable,
      they lurk in caverns and alleyways,
      on rocky cliffs and <em>Rooftops</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city needs heroes. But what manner of hero will you be?
