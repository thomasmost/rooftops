      You are playing <em>Rooftops</em> because you want to play a hero:
      an individual who wants to make the world a better place by thwarting the efforts of those who would take advantage of good people that canâ€™t defend themselves.
      A hero has powers or skills which allow them to do what others would consider impossible.
