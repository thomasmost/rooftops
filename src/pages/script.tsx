         Yes! What can I know of a man I have seen only in his most vulnerable and private moments? How could I possibly attest to the character of a person with whom I share my bed, my body, my hearth and table? A man I have watched eat, for twelve years! Twelve years spent staring across the table at him dismantling potatoes between those big fucking chompers, as he tries to talk and eat at the same time, like an enormous baby with hard opinions about the deteriorating state of Thebes. I have only seen him cry over our third miscarriage, only seen him strike a wall in shame after his first infidelity, only seen him pray to the gods and humble himself before the vast incomprehensibility of space and time. Fuck, I&rsquo;m begging you, illuminate Hostus Hostilius for me, because I do not know him.
